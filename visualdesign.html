  <center><h2> Kaleidoscope project</h2></center>
  <center><img alt="Scope" src="Kaleidoscope.png" height="400" width="500"></center>
    <p> I made my kaleidoscope project by using filters, free transform and by merging and duplicating layers.
      I chose a picture of an ant and used a black and white sketch filter. I then cropped my image, duplicated it and used the free transform tool to rotate the images. 
      Lastly after moving around the images and placing them next to each other. My photo looked like an old photo after all the changes, which I liked.</p>

   <center><h2> Fantastical Beast project</h2></center>
  <center> <img alt="myth" src="shutterstock_5195162772-scaled (1).png" height="400" width="500"></center>
     <p>For my assignment I created a beast with the combination of a lynx, a blue heron, and a horned beetle.
       At first I chose three different animals for my beast which where a bunny, a eel and a lizard but I couldn’t find a way to combine the animals in a way that I liked. 
       My beast can freeze things and they can control the wind. I combined all my animals together by blending in the heron’s wings and the beetle’s horn with the lynx.</p>

     <center><h2> Pixel art project</h2></center>
     <center><img alt="pixels" src="Pixel Character.png" height="400" width"500"></center>
       <p>I started this project by sketching out my character on paper. 
         I then chose the colors and name after picking a name and what they would wear.
         My character’s name is Pixy, she is a bunny with pink hair, purple eyes and tan skin. They wear a purple and white jacket, white, pink, and purple pants and white and pink boots. 
         My character would be in a game set in space where she delivers packages to people while hopping and running around the galaxy as fast as they can before time runs out.</p>

        <p>For my Pop art assignment I chose Tkay Maidza and Beabadoobee. 
          Both subjects that I picked for my project are music artists and I chose them because I like their music. 
          I used the quick selection tool, the crop tool and swatches/color picker to make this project. 
          I chose colors that I like for my subject´s face like blue, purple, green or pink.</p>

         <center><h3>My 6 word memoir: A girl always wandering around aimlessly.</h3></center>
<p>I used the program adobe express to create a collage to for the 6 word memoir I created. 
  I started the project by picking out a color palette that best fits the vibe of my memoir and compiling some of the things that I like. 
  I used mostly purples and used pictures with a lot of words or patterns. I included pictures of things I like because they are apart of me and I thought would relate to my memoir. 
  I think my collage matches my aesthetic because it has things that would describe me if people were to think about me.</p>
