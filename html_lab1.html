<h3><center> Before BECA</center> </h3>
<p><center> I used to go PS.53x and had a lot of and made some friends before middle school. I had a lot a fun memories there. In elementary school I really liked reading and would read at school and afterschool. I also liked drawing and playing games on my 3ds.</center> </p>
  
  
<h3><center>During BECA</center></h3> 
  <p> <center> I been at BECA since middle school. I've had a lot of different teachers and met so many interesting people and made many friends. My interests have also slowly changed overtime even if the difference was small. I would read less but I would draw more. I still play video games and now I like listening to music. I like finding new artists and makinng playlists. I also slack off more than I used to. Here is a list of animals/people/things that my friends have said that I looked like: </center>    </p>
